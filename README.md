cutframe
========
The cutframe program will read some frames from a video or audio data file, 
and then write to another file. There should be a file record the length
of all frames, so that the cutframe program can get the length of each frame
before read a frame from a video or audio data file. Take the file "LenFile.txt"
as a example of length file that record the length of all frames.
